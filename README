PETE MADE A BETTER ONE!
https://github.com/envato/awsraw


#EXAMPLE: 

# api wrapper w/ your aws credentials
s3 = Best3(aws_key, aws_secret_key).s3()

# make a call to s3, args are: http method, REST uri (w/ params), request headers, request body

# get a list of buckets
puts s3.('GET', '/').inspect 

# put a custom acl on an object
puts s3.('PUT', '/path/to/object?acl', {'Content-Type' => 'text/xml'}, acl_in_xml)

# NOTES:
# all output is in the raw rest api output
# wraps signing of requests for you, which is a pain
# currently works with s3 and cloudfront
# very alpha so not all stuff is tested but the library is small
